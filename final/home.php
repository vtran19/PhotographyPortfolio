            <p class="intro-excerpt">My name is Vanessa Tran, and I am a novice/beginner photographer. Please enjoy my website and feel free to give me some feedback! Most of my photos are taken with an iPhone (6s, X, 11 Pro Max), but there are some taken with a DSLR (Canon Rebel T6). I decided to create a portfolio to instill some motivation within myself to start taking photographs again. My multi-year plan is to switch to taking pictures solely on my DSLR to learn more of the basic settings, eventually leading to upgrading my camera. I also would love to shoot in .RAW format and start editing in Adobe LightRoom. It would be incredible to transform photography into a side job in the future. If you have any tips, please donâ€™t forget to share!</p>
