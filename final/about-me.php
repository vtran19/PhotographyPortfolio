                <li>As mentioned on the home page and plastered all over this website, my name is Vanessa Tran, and I have a growing interest in photography. Also, I currently am a student at the University of Vermont with a major in Computer Science.</li>

            <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>As for hobbies, I’ve recently gotten into more outdoorsy endeavors and love to hike, kayak, paddleboard, etc. in my free time, mostly in the warmer months. I’d love to get my hands on a mirrorless camera and a GoPro and capture the many adventures I plan to go on (of course also saving room to be in the moment without any devices).</li>
                <li>Aside from that, my goal in life is to travel the world and experience what the world has in store. It sounds quite cheesy, but I’ve always wanted to see different cultures/parts of the world. It would be even better to photograph the amazing places I’ve seen.</li>
